## My Background

I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area for the entirety of my childhood, before heading off to Southern California. I completed my undergraduate degree in Informatics with an emphasis in Human-Computer Interaction during the pandemic, finishing the last few quarters of my degree remotely back home in the Bay Area. I currently work for [Vincit USA](https://vincit.com), a consulting company that builds a variety of products for the web and mobile devices.

<br>

I am extremely passionate about both the command line and the web when it comes to technology, as I spend all day inside a terminal building websites. I specialize particularly in the front of the frontend, feeling most comfortable when I'm constructing the best user experiences that I possibly can for the web. If you need someone to help you debug an obnoxious CSS issue that you can't figure out, I'm your guy!

In my free time I love to tinker with new tools and frameworks for the web, new command line tools, and my never finished Neovim config (my editor of choice). When I'm not writing code, you'll catch me brewing a cup of coffee, watching English Premier League soccer or NBA basketball, or playing soccer and basketball recreationally. I love to both watch and play sports when I have the time, with soccer being one of my longest standing hobbies since my childhood.
